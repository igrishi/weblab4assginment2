        Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
